## Rationale for Bayesian evaluation

.pull-left[
-   Prior evidence on primary laws:

    -   Strong evidence they reduce deaths and increase seat belt use;

    -   This evidence is dated (1990s, early 2000s).

-   16 states have upgraded to primary since 2000.

.pull-right[
Our aims:

1.  Evaluate recent policy changes.*

2.  Combine the evaluation of recent data with prior evidence.

3.  Provide updated evidence on the impact of upgrading to primary
    enforcement.

## Intuition for Bayesian analysis
Intuition for Bayesian analysis

-   We will generate new empirical evidence on the impact of policy
    changes since 2000.

-   How should we approach inference from this study?

-   Frequentist analysis assumes **zero** background information.

-   Equivalent to belief that primary laws just as likely to:

    -   Decrease death rates by a factor of 100 or 10*;*

    -   *Increase* death rates by a factor 10 or 100.

-   Bayesian inference explicitly incorporates prior information to
    estimate the posterior probability distribution:

$$\underbrace{P(\theta|D)}_{\textrm{posterior probability}}\propto\underbrace{P(D|\theta)}_{\textrm{ likelihood }}\times\underbrace{P(\theta)}_{\textrm{prior probability}}$$

### Prior empirical evidence on upgrades to primary enforcement

- 3 high-quality studies on MVC death rates.
- Mean estimate: -0.5 deaths/billion VMT (-0.7, -0.3) $\rightsquigarrow$ .red[1500 deaths/yr].
- Prediction interval for new trial: (-1.97, 0.94). $\rightsquigarrow$ .red[(-6000, +3000).]
-   On relative scale $RR=0.95$, $95\%CI=0.83,1.09$

### Prior empirical evidence on upgrades to primary enforcement

- 6 moderate-quality studies on proportion belted
- Average estimate: 0.13 (0.10, 0.16). $\rightsquigarrow$ .red[13 percentage points.]
- Prediction interval for new "trial": (0.03, 0.23).
- On relative scale $RR=1.3$, $95\%CI=1.08,1.58$

## Semi-Bayesian analysis via data augmentation
.footnote[Greenland (2006, 2007), Sullivan and Greenland (2013)]

.pull-left[
- Data augmentation expresses prior information by adding empirical observations to the observed data.

- Advantages:

    -   Avoids cumbersome full Bayesian machinery (resampling, MCMC).

    -   Approximates the posterior distribution.
]

--

.pull-right[
How to execute:

1.  Define priors.

2.  Encode priors as observations and add to the observed data.

3.  Conduct analysis on all data.

4.  Regression estimate and 95% CI provide approximations to Bayesian
    posterior mean and credible interval.
