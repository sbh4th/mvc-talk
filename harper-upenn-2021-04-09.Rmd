## Before doing your study: what do you know?

.pull-left[
### Describe your prior beliefs

- Many studies have found excess risks for those consuming cannabis $(X=1)$ compared to those who don't $(X=0)$.

- You think a harmful effect is likely and a protective effect unlikely.

- Based on prior literature, theory, mechanisms, biology, etc.
]

### Quantify your prior beliefs
- Translate your beliefs into probability statements.

- E.g., you're 95% sure that exposure to cannabis increases the risk of a crash between 0% and 40%

- Can be represented by a prior distribution: $N(.20, 0.1)$*

## Interpretation

.pull-left[
### Frequentist inference
- No probability statements about hypothesis of interest.
- p-value gives evidence of compatibility of observed data with the null, given the model and assuming the null hypothesis is true.
- 95%CI: If we took a large number of repeated samples and computed the 95% CI each time, then 95% of these intervals would contain the true parameter. 
]

.pull-right[
### Bayesian inference:
- Direct statements about probability of hypothesis from the posterior distribution.
- Can say 95% probability that parameter is within the limits of the interval.
- Is a learning process and is updated with new information.
- But priors require subjectivity...
]

## Summary
.right-column[
### Honest uncertainty
#### Quantitatively incorporating prior knowledge.

### Priors need defending
#### Based on substance. Non-informative are rarely defensible.

- 16 states have upgraded to primary since 2000.

- Concerns about unintended consequences.

#### We will generate new empirical evidence on the impact of policy changes since 2000.

---
## Intuition for Bayesian analysis
.pull-left[
- Frequentist analysis ignores background information.

- Equivalent to belief that primary laws just as likely to:
  - Decrease death rates by a factor of 100 or 10.
  
  - *Increase* death rates by a factor 10 or 100.
  
- .red[This is also a prior.]
]

--

.pull-right[
- Use priors to encode existing information.

- Bayesian inference explicitly incorporates prior information to estimate the posterior probability distribution:

$$\underbrace{P(\theta|D)}_{\textrm{posterior}}\propto\underbrace{P(D|\theta)}_{\textrm{ likelihood }}\times\underbrace{P(\theta)}_{\textrm{prior}}$$

# Methods
## Design and analysis


---
## Semi-Bayesian analysis via data augmentation
.footnote[Greenland (2006, 2007), Sullivan and Greenland (2013)]

.pull-left[
- Data augmentation expresses prior information by adding empirical observations to the observed data.

- Advantages:

    -   Avoids cumbersome full Bayesian machinery (resampling, MCMC).

    -   Approximates the posterior distribution.
]

--

.pull-right[
How to execute:

1.  Define priors.

2.  Encode priors as observations and add to the observed data.

3.  Conduct analysis on all data.

4.  Regression estimate and 95% CI provide approximations to Bayesian
    posterior mean and credible interval.
]

---
## Why *semi-* Bayes and not fully Bayes?
.right-column[
### Focus
#### Only interested in the policy effect, not other parameters.

### Clustered treatment
#### Straightforward with conventional software, harder with fully specified Bayesian framework.

### Convenience
#### Much less computationally intensive.
]

---
## How do we augment the observed data?
.footnote[*Higgins & Spiegelhalter (2000); Greenland (2007,2008). Check these numbers yourself in Stata by typing `csi 4 4 99996 99996`]

- One way to think about priors is as bets on the "true" effect.
- Suppose we were 95% sure the true $RR$ is between (0.25, 4).
- What kind of data would correspond to the prior?*
- Imagine we had a small randomized evaluation of upgrading to primary enforcement:


|        |  Primary  | Secondary  |  Estimates  |
|--------| :-------: | :--------: | -----------------------------|  
|Deaths  |     4     |     4      | $RR_{prior}=1.0$ |  
|Pop     |  100,000  |  100,000   | $95\%CI_{prior}=(0.25,4.0)$ |  
 
- Add these prior data to our observed data as an additional stratum.
- Literally.

---
## Construction of priors
.footnote[*NHTSA, Primary Enforcement Saves Lives (2006); CDC, Motor Vehicle Prioritizing Interventions.]

- Specify prior interval for the $RR$ (effect of law), translated into mean and
    variance.
    
--

3 sets of priors:
1.  **Non-informative**: similar to frequentist assumptions. $\rightsquigarrow N(ln(1),100)$

2.  **Empirical**: prediction interval from prior meta-analysis.
    -   MVC: 95% bet that true $RR$ between 0.83, 1.09 $\rightsquigarrow N(ln(0.95),0.005)$
    -   %belted: 95% bet that true $RR$ between 1.08, 1.58 $\rightsquigarrow N(ln(1.30),0.009)$
    
3.  **Subjective**: from existing policy documents.*
  - Estimate 7-8% reduction on fatalities, 12 to 18 percentage points on seat belt use.
    - We add some additional uncertainty around these estimates.

---
## Summary of prior record construction
.left-column[
- Recall the priors encode **information** that we append to our data.

- Means adding deaths and person-time.
]

.right-column[
![](images/prior-records.png)
]

---
## Data

- Person-level FARS data on fatal crashes and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System (FARS), 2000-2016.

- Dates of primary enforcement upgrades in each state.

- Other time-varying state policies:
  - Speed limits;
  - Graduated driver's license programs;
  - Blood alcohol content laws.

-  Other time-varying state covariates:  
  - Police per capita;
  - Per capita alcohol consumption;
  -  Median income.

---
### Data structure (10 ages x 50 states x 17 years ~ n=8500)
![](images/data-structure.png)

---
### How do we add the prior? (empirical version)
- First define the mean and variance for the prior  
```stata
set obs 1        // only adding 1 record for 1 parameter
gen m = ln(0.95) // mean, i.e., RR=0.95
gen v = 0.005    // variance, equiv to 95%CI 0.83, 1.09
gen s = 25       // scaling factor
```  

--

- Next set a variable representing number of prior cases, based on the variance 
of the prior and the scaling factor to facilitate normality (if using). 
```stata
gen a = round(25^2 / 0.005,0) // num of prior cases
gen c = 0 // set constant to 0 for prior records, 1 for actual data
```

---

- Now set a variable for which prior is constructed to 1 for the covariate of interest, as well as equivalent person-time based on prior. Save as a dataset.
```stata
gen cov = 1 / 25
gen pt = a / exp(-0.95 / 25) // person-time for prior record
save "$cdir/data/derived/priorf2", replace
list
     +-------------------------------------------------------------+
     | prior           m      v    s        a   c   cov         pt |
     |-------------------------------------------------------------|
     |     2   -.0512933   .005   25   125000   0   .04   129841.4 |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------+
```
- Append this prior data to the observed data
```stata
use "$cdir/data/derived/mvc-laws-prior-data.dta", clear
append using "$cdir/data/derived/priorf1"
```
- Analyze the entire dataset using 'standard' methods.
- No Bayesian machinery needed.

## Likelihood model specifications
.footnote[*speed limit laws, graduated driver's license laws, BAC laws,
    alcohol consumption per capita, police officers per capita, state
    median income, police reported alcohol involved, and proportion of
    crash deaths on rural roads.]

### For MVC death rates
- Poisson model, i.e., $y_{ast}\sim Poisson(\mu_{ast})$:

$$ln(\mu_{ast})=\alpha+{\color{red}\beta\times Primary_{st}}+\boldsymbol{\gamma}\mathbf{A}_{ast}+\boldsymbol{\delta}\mathbf{Z}_{st}+\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{s}+\boldsymbol{\tau}_{t}+ln\left(VMT_{ast}\right)$$

where:
 - ${y}_{ast}$ is deaths for age group *a*, state *s*, and time *t*.
 - $Primary=1$ when a primary enforcement law is in effect
 - $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$, $\delta$, are coefficients for
    age groups $(\mathbf{A}_{ast})$, other time-varying state covariates $(\mathbf{Z}_{st})$ *
 - $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, and $\mathsf{\boldsymbol{\tau}}$ are state and year fixed effects, respectively.
 - ${VMT}_{ast}$ is vehicle miles traveled (billions)
    

---
## Likelihood model specifications
### For proportion belted
- Grouped logit model:

$$ln\left(p_{ast}/[1-p_{ast}]\right)=\alpha+{\color{red}\beta\times Primary_{st}}+\boldsymbol{\gamma}\mathbf{A}_{ast}+\boldsymbol{\delta}\mathbf{Z}_{st}+\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{s}+\boldsymbol{\tau}_{t}$$
where:
- $p_{ast}$ is the proportion of deaths wearing a seat belt in age group *a* and state *s* at time *t*.
- other coefficients as before.


- SEs clustered by state
- Reporting marginal effects on probability scale

## Fully Bayesian analysis
.footnote[*Rstan model bglm2 results above, 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1; total post-warmup samples = 4000)]

![](images/full-bayes.png)

---
## Added benefit of full Bayes: estimate anything!

- Creating a full posterior distribution allows lots of flexibility to estimate different quantities of interest (we don't have to be slaves to NHST).
- E.g., what is the probability that the law parameter is < -0.05?

.left-column[
$P(\beta<-0.05 | \theta)=0.04$

or < -0.03?

$P(\beta<-0.03 | \theta)=0.87$

These statements are impossible with frequentist inference.

## Conclusions
.right-column[
### Bayesian interpretation
#### Newer evidence suggests weaker impact, despite priors.

### Other mechanisms
#### Continued declines in MVC death rates due to improved road and vehicle technology, traffic calming measures, or other changes.

### Heterogeneity
#### Recent converts to seat belt use (due to law upgrades) may be a subpopulation with different risks.
